## Exercise 1 - Algebra

This exercise is a review of algebraic expressions and the order of operations.

**Mathematical Operators**

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Addition | 2 + 2 = 4 |
| - | Subtraction | 4 - 2 = 2 |
| * | Multiplication | 2 * 2 = 4 |
| / | Division | 4 / 2 = 2 |
| // | Floor Division | 5 // 2 = 2 |
| % | Modulus (remainder) | 5 % 2 = 1 |
| ** | Exponentiation | 2 ** 3 = 8 |


**Order of Operations**

| Order | Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ** | Exponentiation | 2 ** 3 = 8 |
| 2 | * / // % | Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulus | 2 * 3 = 6 |
| 3 | + - | Addition, Subtraction | 2 + 3 = 5 |

## Exercise 2 - Factors of a given number

In the `2-factors.py` file, write a program that asks the user to enter a number and then prints all the factors of that number.

## Exercise 3 - Number Sets

In the `3-number-sets.py` file, write a program that asks the user to enter a number and then prints if the number is a member of any of the following sets:

- Natural Numbers
- Whole Numbers
- Integers
- Rational Numbers
- Real Numbers

Q. Why might you not want to write a program that can classify a number as a member of the set of Irrational Numbers?

## Exercise 4 - Binary to Decimal

In the `4-binary-to-decimal.py` file, write a program that asks the user to enter a binary number and then prints the decimal equivalent of that number.
